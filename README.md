# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# The Problem & The Solution
In the current scenario, in many states, the individuals are producing electricity using renewable resources and they produce more than what they consume. So, our idea is to create an electricity exchange platform at peer-to-peer level that allows producers/consumers to buy/sell electricity at an individual level and transfer it virtually, mean while our platform acts as broker and earns brokarage.

## Key Features
- A common platform will be used to connect the population with its power station. 
- The current rate at which the electricity is produced will be shown.
- People will be able to analyze the current rate and perform trading just like stock market.
- The trading will be on a blockchain platform between different producers and the government.
- The buy amount, sell amount and overall amount (buy-sell) will be displayed.
- The user can request to stop or resume the supply of electricity from power station at any time.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
